# EnMan - Energy Management

Project is under development

## Goals
1. Provide a central application for managing your energy needs.
2. Integrate Victron and Carlo Gavazzi devices and make it easy to integrate other vendors.
3. Act as a proxy for Carlo Gavazzi devices so Victron can still read them via modbus.
4. Take a home battery into account.
5. Take a car charging station into account. We don't want to charge a car from the home batteries.
6. Take dynamic pricing into account. Try to ear money by buying and selling on the right moments.
7. Take other devices with a high load into account. Think of induction cookers and water pre-heaters.
